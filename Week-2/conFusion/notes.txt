Foundations for Responsive Design
1. Grid System
2. Fluid Images
3. Media Queries

view port
---------
-- ensures that the screen width is set to the device width and the content is rendered with this width in mind.

Bootstrap
---------
-- uses CSS Flexbox layout from version 4
-- supports direction-agnostic layout
how does the grid works
1. class = container 
    fixed with container.
    container-fluid --
2. each container is divided into rows
3. Each row in divided in to 12 columns.
4. Bootstrap provides 5 classes
    -- default targets all screen sizes from xs to xl
    -- sm
    -- md
    -- lg
    -- xl
5. use the classes to specify columns sizes col-* col-sm-*
6. col-sm-5 means from small to extra large screen this element will occupy s columns.
7. we can also skip no.of columns .col-sm, if there are 3 such elements then each will occupy 4 columns.
8. Gutter width : 30px(15px on each side of column)
9. Max container width : device width
    sm : 540px : >= 576px
    medium: 720px : >= 768px
    large: 960px : >=992px
    extra large: 1140px : >=1200px
10. Reordering content
    order-sm-first - this makes element to be pushed towards first
    order-sm-last - this makes element to be pushed towards last
11. Vertical Alignment
    Applied to row class
        align-items-center,start,end
    Applied to column class
        align-self-center,start,end
12. Horizontal Alignment    '
    Applied to row class
        justify-content-center - start,end,between,around
13 Offset:
    offset-sm-1 : means content to be right shifted by 1 columns from sm to xl screens
